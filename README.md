# shamey-deliveries

A free, open-source RedM script for deliveries using carts/wagons.

Beat the clock to deliver the goods safely!

## Features
- Timed wagon deliveries
- "Hazard" route with explosives (and actual explosions upon crash)
- Anti-cheat (detects & prevents players from using the auto-navigation in Cinematic camera mode)
- Highly configurable (origin spots, destinations, timers, payouts, vehicle)
- Discord logging (via webhook)
- Organized & documented
- Performant

## Player Guide
1. Approach a delivery origin spot (map blip). You may need to get very close and wait a couple of seconds.
2. Follow the prompt to open the menu.
3. Scroll through the menu and select a delivery mission.
4. A wagon will spawn nearby. Your character will automatically get on it.
5. There will be a yellow path in your minimap. Follow that path.
6. Time reminder notifications will appear during your journey.
7. If you crash or if time runs out, the wagon will despawn and you receive no money. If you arrive safely and finish the delivery before time runs out, you will receive an in-game payout.

## Requirements
- VORP Framework (other frameworks would just require some changes to the code)

## License & Support
This software was formerly proprietary to Rainbow Railroad Roleplay, but I am now releasing it free and open-source under GNU GPLv3. I cannot provide any support.
